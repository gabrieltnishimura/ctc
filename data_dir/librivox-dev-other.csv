data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0000.flac,231911,yet so strong was the effect upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectation of the word which should make him rich
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0001.flac,95447,a part of that impression was due to the engagement which he must now fulfil
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0002.flac,109758,to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0003.flac,249746,because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many charms step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that raw attachment
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0004.flac,97128,unable to think of work he left the house and wandered gloomily about regent's park
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0005.flac,135709,he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fate's instrument
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0006.flac,32734,he wrote to marian
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0007.flac,55841,will you let me hear or come and see me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0008.flac,72393,i scarcely thought of biffen as likely to kill himself
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0009.flac,70715,but why the deuce did he go all the way out there
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0010.flac,48710,i hoped you would bring me some news
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0011.flac,47786,poverty i can only suppose
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0012.flac,89836,but i will see whelpdale i hadn't come across biffen for a long time
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0013.flac,52149,was he still so very poor
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0014.flac,42654,asked amy compassionately
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0015.flac,66133,i'm afraid so his book failed utterly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0016.flac,130731,oh if i had imagined him still in such distress surely i might have done something to help him
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0017.flac,81645,perchance his death was in part attributable to that hopeless love
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0018.flac,98724,he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0019.flac,115903,having this subject to converse upon put the two more quickly at ease than could otherwise have been the case
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0020.flac,70055,amy might take a foremost place among brilliant women
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0021.flac,71900,especially now that her father is threatened with blindness
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0022.flac,43285,is it so serious
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0023.flac,119287,even if mister yule recovers his sight it is not at all likely that he will be able to work as before
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0024.flac,60352,our difficulties are so grave that
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0025.flac,74073,he paused and let his hand fail despondently
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0026.flac,129550,i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0027.flac,34497,there was silence
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0028.flac,100265,the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my position
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0029.flac,57305,recall where i stood when you first knew me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0030.flac,59510,just now i am in need of a little encouragement
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0031.flac,66866,you don't notice any falling off in my work recently
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0032.flac,85969,do you see my things in the current and so on generally
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0033.flac,75259,sometimes i believe i have detected you when there was no signature
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0034.flac,68034,her story in that girls paper has attracted attention
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0035.flac,98077,and i could so easily put her at rest by renouncing all claim upon her
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0036.flac,115995,i surmise that that you yourself would also be put at rest by such a decision
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0037.flac,69035,don't look at me with that ironical smile he pleaded
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0038.flac,223565,i couldn't go about declaring that i was heartbroken in any event i must be content for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgments are pretty sure to be unfavourable what can i do
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0039.flac,76684,the case is too delicate i fear for my advice
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0040.flac,50932,well i'll go back to my scribbling
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0041.flac,93160,again jasper held the white soft hand for a superfluous moment
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0042.flac,95468,yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0043.flac,98687,marian could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companion's smooth countenance
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0044.flac,171850,she had divined that there was some grave reason for this summons and the panting with which she had approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0045.flac,34513,he began abruptly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0046.flac,82912,he gave her such details as he had obtained then added
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0047.flac,62093,there are two of my companions fallen in the battle
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0048.flac,72988,i ought to think myself a lucky fellow marian what
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0049.flac,61857,you are better fitted to fight your way jasper
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0050.flac,37948,more of a brute you mean
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0051.flac,44895,you know very well i don't
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0052.flac,80168,i have made up my mind about our affairs he went on presently
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0053.flac,27458,yes
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0054.flac,58930,will you marry me and let us take our chance
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0055.flac,80528,you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0056.flac,80340,i should be so afraid of the effect upon his health jasper
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0057.flac,60997,she paused and looked up at him touchingly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0058.flac,111348,dear i can't feel it would be my duty to renounce you because my father had become blind
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0059.flac,42440,has one thing occurred to you
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0060.flac,109611,will he consent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus milvain
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0061.flac,96223,and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0062.flac,55429,she listened anxiously and reflected
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0063.flac,127891,as i have said there is the very serious doubt whether your father would accept money from you when you are my wife
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0064.flac,98156,it isn't your fault marian and well then there's only one thing to do
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0065.flac,116714,except jasper that if father is helpless i must find means of assuring his support
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0066.flac,42010,do you think them insurmountable
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0067.flac,106586,that is just what i have decided is impossible marian you shall have the plain truth
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0068.flac,51585,i don't trust myself
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0069.flac,53997,but shall you face them willingly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0070.flac,39046,put up your umbrella marian
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0071.flac,168706,what do i care for a drop of rain she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is at stake how am i to understand you
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0072.flac,74863,every word you speak seems intended to dishearten me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0073.flac,68159,why need you conceal it if that is the truth
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0074.flac,73007,is that what you mean by saying you distrust yourself
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0075.flac,49333,we must see each other again marian
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0076.flac,76334,how am i to live an hour in such uncertainty as this
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0077.flac,36751,i do wish it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0078.flac,68989,her emotion had an effect upon him and his voice trembled
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0079.flac,97991,there is no natural law that a child should surrender everything for her parents
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0080.flac,92639,you know so much more of the world than i do can't you advise me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0081.flac,61350,is there no way of providing for my father
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0082.flac,91494,good god this is frightful marian i can't stand it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0083.flac,46606,i will be faithful to you
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0084.flac,203700,he had made a pretence of holding his umbrella over her but marian turned away and walked to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0085.flac,101244,moving to follow he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0086.flac,59579,in what can there be more selfishness
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0087.flac,100826,but i couldn't say a word that would seem to invite such misery as this
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0088.flac,81840,you don't love me jasper and that's an end of everything
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0089.flac,65221,happiness or misery come to us by fate
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0090.flac,54795,is it in my power to make you happy
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0091.flac,106150,but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0092.flac,70488,if i believe anything i believe that i did love you
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0093.flac,70731,what can you say to me more than you have said now
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0094.flac,212584,remember me as a man who disregarded priceless love such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools and knaves indeed that's what it comes to
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0095.flac,144191,soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merited my perverse pride would revolt against it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0096.flac,41372,what can be simpler than the truth
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0097.flac,142503,it is a thing that happens every day either in man or woman and all that honour demands is the courage to confess the truth
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0098.flac,148740,marian will you do this will you let our engagement last for another six months but without our meeting during that time
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0099.flac,43371,that seems to me childish
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0100.flac,96397,the rain fell unceasingly and with it began to mingle an autumnal mist
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0101.flac,60713,jasper delayed a moment then asked calmly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0102.flac,58157,are you going to the museum yes
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0103.flac,69809,go home again for this morning marian you can't work
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0104.flac,63249,i must and i have no time to lose
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0105.flac,50354,good bye she gave him her hand
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0106.flac,128247,they looked at each other for an instant then marian left the shelter of the tree opened her umbrella and walked quickly away
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0107.flac,118776,jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who is suffering a severe humiliation
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0108.flac,114747,his sister said very little for she recognised genuine suffering in his tones and aspect
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0109.flac,225482,a few weeks ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is very rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0110.flac,84782,yesterday morning he received her final answer a refusal
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0111.flac,124514,you will understand though surely you need no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he is of you
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0112.flac,93658,you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0113.flac,62258,several days passed before there came a reply
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4515-11057-0114.flac,189744,i must only ask that you will write to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always about yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0000.flac,61418,she draws close and satisfies
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0001.flac,120847,he could not forget missus pine avon's eyes though he remembered nothing of her other facial details
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0002.flac,170171,afterwards they kept apart awhile in the drawing room for form's sake but eventually gravitated together again and finished the evening in each other's company
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0003.flac,30218,but this was not all
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0004.flac,30081,but was he able
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0005.flac,153285,it was unfair to go further without telling her even though hitherto such explicitness had not been absolutely demanded
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0006.flac,79252,he determined to call immediately on the new incarnation
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0007.flac,171566,she lived not far from the long fashionable hamptonshire square and he went thither with expectations of having a highly emotional time at least
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0008.flac,106361,but somehow the very bell pull seemed cold although she had so earnestly asked him to come
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0009.flac,271067,raising her eyes in a slightly inquiring manner from the book she was reading she leant back in the chair as if soaking herself in luxurious sensations which had nothing to do with him and replied to his greeting with a few commonplace words
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0010.flac,214556,just as they turn madeira into port in the space of a single night so this old air has been taken and doctored and twisted about and brought out as a new popular ditty indeed
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0011.flac,313896,she thawed a little and then they went on to talk about her house which had been newly painted and decorated with greenish blue satin up to the height of a person's head an arrangement that somewhat improved her slightly faded though still pretty face and was helped by the awnings over the windows
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0012.flac,122379,yes i have had my house some years she observed complacently and i like it better every year
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0013.flac,73393,don't you feel lonely in it sometimes o never
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0014.flac,75919,what an uncivil thing to say she murmured in surprise
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0015.flac,34264,it is rather uncivil
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0016.flac,86021,as a punishment she did not ring the bell but left him to find his way out as he could
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0017.flac,55830,i saw him at lady channelcliffe's the other night
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0018.flac,36412,jocelyn pierston
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0019.flac,40805,o didn't he marry her
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0020.flac,41166,said missus pine avon with a start
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0021.flac,84778,but jocelyn was receding from the pretty widow's house with long strides
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0022.flac,175819,lady iris had left the drawing room for a moment to see that all was right in the dining room and when he was shown in there stood alone in the lamplight nichola pine avon
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0023.flac,39701,she had been the first arrival
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0024.flac,162550,as the other guests dropped in the pair retreated into a shady corner and she talked beside him till all moved off for the eating and drinking
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0025.flac,116637,he had not been appointed to take her across to the dining room but at the table found her exactly opposite
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0026.flac,110935,the spring in the present case was the artistic commendation she deserved and craved
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0027.flac,200739,the lady on jocelyn's left wife of a lord justice of appeal was in like manner talking to her companion on the outer side so that for the time he was left to himself
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90413-0028.flac,211904,it came from the wife of one of his father's former workmen and was concerning her son whom she begged jocelyn to recommend as candidate for some post in town that she wished him to fill
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0000.flac,53157,things arrange themselves
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0001.flac,71616,but the countess never gave way an inch
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0002.flac,103044,the following was the answer which she returned to the note written to her by aunt julia
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0003.flac,116209,i should not know how to drink wine with them and should do a hundred things which would make them think me a beast
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0004.flac,48361,but the girl begged for some delay
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0005.flac,56331,it was a matter that required to be considered
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0006.flac,65739,pride in him might be as weak as pride in them
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0007.flac,91587,if they would put out their hands to him why should he refuse to put out his own
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0008.flac,345350,our tailor received him courteously having learned to like the man understanding that he had behaved with honesty and wisdom in regard to his client and respecting him as one of the workers of the day but he declared that for the lovel family as a family he did not care for them particularly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0009.flac,62410,they are poles asunder from me he said
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0010.flac,150568,but by your good fortune and merit if you will allow me to say so you have travelled from the one pole very far towards the other
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0011.flac,112158,at present i think that the sense of the country is in favour of an aristocracy of birth
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0012.flac,86227,when you were foremost among them did you not wish to be their master
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0013.flac,125000,it is one to which all legislative and all human efforts should and must tend
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0014.flac,100129,when you make much water boil mister thwaite some of it will probably boil over
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0015.flac,149053,i quite agree with you that the silk gowns should be kept for their elders and so the conversation was ended
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0016.flac,113451,with her there was a real wish that the poles might be joined together by her future husband
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0017.flac,63286,if you really wish it you shall go he said
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0018.flac,73857,and a blue one to be married in alas me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0019.flac,77556,must i have a pink silk gown to walk about in early in the morning

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0021.flac,42676,i can do that too
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-74899-0022.flac,58441,and now i'll sit down and write a letter to my lord
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0000.flac,89180,he hoped nothing serious had happened to drag her out at such an untoward time
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0001.flac,129795,but as the rain gave not the least sign of cessation he observed i think we shall have to go back never
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0002.flac,35753,why not he inquired
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0003.flac,85837,i cannot understand how you should know me while i have no knowledge of you
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0004.flac,57546,oh but you know me about me at least
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0005.flac,34684,i should think so
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0006.flac,49101,he's my father indeed
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0007.flac,93011,but we have been tenants of sylvania castle on the island here this season
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0008.flac,81039,my father's is a comparatively humble residence hard by
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0009.flac,54697,but he could afford a much bigger one if he chose
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0010.flac,28818,you have heard so
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0011.flac,61341,i don't know he doesn't tell me much of his affairs
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0012.flac,108167,my father she burst out suddenly is always scolding me for my extravagance
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0013.flac,42147,was that this evening
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0014.flac,44913,and there on the nets they sat
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0015.flac,151299,jocelyn thought it strange that he should be thrown by fate into a position to play the son of the montagues to this daughter of the capulets
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0016.flac,84704,no i shall go on and get a lodging in budmouth town if ever i reach it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0017.flac,120319,it is so late that there will be no house open except a little place near the station where you won't care to stay
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0018.flac,51158,the island was an island still
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0019.flac,60915,they had not realized the force of the elements till now
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0020.flac,101505,he steadied her bodily by encircling her waist with his arm and she made no objection
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0021.flac,81156,he pitied her and while he wondered at it admired her determination
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0022.flac,118966,their application for admission led to the withdrawal of a bolt and they stood within the gaslight of the passage
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0023.flac,146924,he could see now that though she was such a fine figure quite as tall as himself she was but in the bloom of young womanhood
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0024.flac,73166,i will tell the servant to do this and send you up something to eat
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0025.flac,135270,he felt ravenously hungry himself and set about drying his clothes as well as he could and eating at the same time
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0026.flac,197973,by the aid of some temporary wraps and some slippers from the cupboard he was contriving to make himself comfortable when the maid servant came downstairs with a damp armful of woman's raiment
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0027.flac,49002,you are sleepy my girl said pierston
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0028.flac,81742,he again became conscious of the change which had been initiated during the walk
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0029.flac,93058,the well beloved was moving house had gone over to the wearer of this attire
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-90407-0030.flac,43001,and how about little avice caro
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0000.flac,496572,it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity when with impressible persons love becomes solicitousness hope sinks to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0001.flac,270044,still to a close observer they are just as perceptible the difference is that their media of manifestation are less trite and familiar than such well known ones as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0002.flac,145271,if anything could be darker than the sky it was the wall and if any thing could be gloomier than the wall it was the river beneath
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0003.flac,189692,an indescribable succession of dull blows perplexing in their regularity sent their sound with difficulty through the fluffy atmosphere
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0004.flac,78526,not long after a form moved by the brink of the river
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0005.flac,91455,this was all that was positively discoverable though it seemed human
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0006.flac,154205,the shape went slowly along but without much exertion for the snow though sudden was not as yet more than two inches deep
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0007.flac,85643,at this time some words were spoken aloud one
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0008.flac,35758,two three
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0009.flac,39754,four five
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0010.flac,103317,between each utterance the little shape advanced about half a dozen yards
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0011.flac,61057,here the spot stopped and dwindled smaller
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0012.flac,98784,then a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0013.flac,257665,the river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort which races middle and sides with the same gliding precision any irregularities of speed being immediately corrected by a small whirlpool
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0014.flac,55575,the window was struck again in the same manner
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0015.flac,80253,then a noise was heard apparently produced by the opening of the window
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0016.flac,64791,said the blurred spot in the snow tremulously
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0017.flac,60875,i asked which was your window forgive me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0018.flac,41243,well i said that you might
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0019.flac,83987,o must i it is when shall we be married frank
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0020.flac,30436,i have money
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0021.flac,72265,and we live in two parishes do we what then
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0022.flac,50846,if i said so of course i will
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0023.flac,62297,the fact is i forgot to ask
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1255-138279-0024.flac,48398,good night frank good night
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-102353-0000.flac,166828,we had then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of the continent which was requisite for a determination of the problem
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-102353-0001.flac,197071,several different parties were therefore organized to examine the various routes supposed to be practicable within the northern and southern limits of the united states
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-102353-0002.flac,274239,the only discrimination made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the surveys
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-102353-0003.flac,150353,inquiries were made with regard to gunpowder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for artillery
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-102353-0004.flac,187436,the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil life
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-102353-0005.flac,174534,under instructions from the president the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-102353-0006.flac,124173,after some further discussion of the question the visitors withdrew dissatisfied with the result of the interview
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-102353-0007.flac,248470,the quartermaster general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake that the appointee to the office had been confounded with his father who was a well known whig but that he the son was a democrat
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-102353-0008.flac,244304,i assured the general that this was altogether immaterial adding that it was a very pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had no desire to effect a settlement of it on any inferior issue
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-14911-0000.flac,175077,nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the foxhound are very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-14911-0001.flac,241813,if you want to hunt your harriers on foot sixteen inches is quite big enough almost too big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches is a useful height or even nineteen inches
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-14911-0002.flac,154248,it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule as to colour it is so much a matter of individual taste
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-14911-0003.flac,144799,but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to be kept and reared until they are old enough to be entered to their work
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-14911-0004.flac,208568,he is of course finer but with the length of neck so perfect in the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same pattern and the typical quarters and second thighs
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-14911-0005.flac,134820,and when he is fairly on a line of course he sticks to it as the saying is like a beagle
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-14911-0006.flac,321472,it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otterhound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of good eighteen inches and an almost identical contemporary that was called the essex beagle
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-14911-0007.flac,268286,that a great many of the true order were bred became very manifest as soon as the harrier and beagle association was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show was reserved for them
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-14911-0008.flac,52168,then they seemed to spring from every part of the country
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-14911-0009.flac,377676,one hears now of the chauston the halstead place very noted indeed the hulton the leigh park the stoke place the edinburgh the surbiton the trinity foot the wooddale missus g w hilliard's missus price's and missus turner's

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0000.flac,86419,such a corps such a time you never did see
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0001.flac,122717,i was wishing somebody would give the conversation a start when indiany made a break
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0002.flac,95785,this ain't no great stock country says he to the old gentleman with the cane
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0003.flac,58294,no sir says the old gentleman
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0004.flac,89194,there's very little grazing here and the range is pretty much wore out
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0005.flac,161807,the young lady smiled through her veil and the old lady snapped her eyes and looked sideways at the speaker
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0006.flac,190964,i'm gwine down to orleans to see if i can't git a contract out of uncle sam to feed the boys what's been lickin them infernal mexicans so bad
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0007.flac,170247,i've read some accounts of the battle says the old gentleman that didn't give a very flattering account of the conduct of some of our troops
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0008.flac,166504,the old preacher listened to him with evident signs of displeasure twistin and groanin till he couldn't stand it no longer
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0009.flac,205762,he shut his mouth right in the middle of what he was sayin and looked at the preacher while his face got as red as fire
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0010.flac,139401,swearin says the old preacher is a terrible bad practice and there ain't no use in it nohow
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0011.flac,105047,umphs but indiany kept shady he appeared to be cowed down
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0012.flac,160657,the old gentleman with the cane took a part in the conversation and the hoosier listened without ever opening his head
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0013.flac,160154,he was at sodom and gomorrow and seen the place whar lot's wife fell ah
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0014.flac,224520,yes says the preacher he went to the very spot and what's the remarkablest thing of all he seen the pillar of salt what she was turned into
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0015.flac,98744,yes sir he seen the salt standin thar to this day
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0016.flac,90880,what says the hoosier real genewine good salt
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0017.flac,146807,yes sir a pillar of salt jest as it was when that wicked woman was punished for her disobedience
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-56594-0018.flac,50184,right out in the open air he asked
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-24733-0000.flac,365435,all things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of god must always exist and be infinite or in other words are eternal and infinite through the said attribute
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-24733-0001.flac,647331,proof conceive if it be possible supposing the proposition to be denied that something in some attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of the said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-24733-0002.flac,64079,in its nature infinite
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-24733-0003.flac,75456,must necessarily exist
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-24733-0004.flac,562660,we have now granted therefore thought not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from its nature in so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against our hypothesis
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-24733-0005.flac,624900,and beyond the limits of the duration of the idea of god supposing the latter at some time not to have existed or not to be going to exist thought would perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our hypothesis for we supposed that thought being given the idea of god necessarily flowed therefrom
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-24733-0006.flac,280022,bear in mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from god's absolute nature
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4570-24733-0007.flac,462927,corollary hence it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is in scholastic phraseology god is cause of the being of things essendi rerum

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0008.flac,94521,they had often gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing elaine
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0009.flac,178332,the black shawl having been procured anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0010.flac,99628,it spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before missus lynde was born
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0011.flac,41213,jane you arrange this
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0012.flac,55882,it's silly for elaine to be talking when she's dead
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0013.flac,46595,jane rose to the occasion
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0014.flac,44969,left behind at the landing
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0015.flac,154067,anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard she was white to the lips but she did not lose her self possession
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0016.flac,51736,there was one chance just one
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0017.flac,91216,under such circumstances you don't think much about making a flowery prayer
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0018.flac,78218,the flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0019.flac,189744,ruby jane and diana already awaiting it on the lower headland saw it disappear before their very eyes and had not a doubt but that anne had gone down with it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0020.flac,96548,the minutes passed by each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0021.flac,71573,why didn't somebody come where had the girls gone
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0022.flac,90563,her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0023.flac,34632,anne shirley
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0024.flac,62234,how on earth did you get there he exclaimed
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0025.flac,98495,it was certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0026.flac,39034,what has happened anne
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0027.flac,49001,asked gilbert taking up his oars
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0028.flac,178655,we were playing elaine explained anne frigidly without even looking at her rescuer and i had to drift down to camelot in the barge i mean the flat
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0029.flac,49320,for a moment anne hesitated
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0030.flac,54129,her heart gave a quick queer little beat
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0031.flac,160772,her resentment which to other and older people might be as laughable as its cause was in no whit allayed and softened by time seemingly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0032.flac,116863,no she said coldly i shall never be friends with you gilbert blythe and i don't want to be
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0033.flac,30281,all right
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0034.flac,89663,i'll never ask you to be friends again anne shirley and i don't care either
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0035.flac,84857,of course he had insulted her terribly but still
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0036.flac,76897,everything i do gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0037.flac,98020,anne's presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt to do
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0038.flac,75917,will you ever have any sense anne groaned marilla
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0039.flac,53613,i don't see how said marilla
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122868-0040.flac,152070,ever since i came to green gables i've been making mistakes and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0000.flac,52283,vanity and vexation of spirit
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0001.flac,161327,the spring was abroad in the land and marilla's sober middle aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep primal gladness
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0002.flac,150769,i must say with all her faults i never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and i'm real sorry to find her so now
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0003.flac,70120,perhaps you're judging her too hasty marilla
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0004.flac,83249,of course i knew you'd take her part matthew but i'm bringing her up not you
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0005.flac,72066,demanded marilla anxiously going over to the bed
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0006.flac,149417,anne cowered deeper into her pillows as if desirous of hiding herself forever from mortal eyes no
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0007.flac,45910,get right up this minute and tell me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0008.flac,69804,this minute i say there now what is it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0009.flac,71388,anne had slid to the floor in despairing obedience
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0010.flac,57892,yes it's green moaned anne
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0011.flac,62881,i thought nothing could be as bad as red hair
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0012.flac,89850,you haven't got into any scrape for over two months and i was sure another one was due
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0013.flac,58133,now then what did you do to your hair
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0014.flac,87282,anne shirley didn't you know it was a wicked thing to do
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0015.flac,73342,yes i knew it was a little wicked admitted anne
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0016.flac,55419,i know what it feels like to have your word doubted
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0017.flac,134273,and missus allan says we should never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they're not
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0018.flac,91278,but i hadn't then and i believed every word he said implicitly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0019.flac,58559,who said who are you talking about
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0020.flac,53444,oh i didn't let him in the house
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0021.flac,131756,in a trice i saw myself with beautiful raven black hair and the temptation was irresistible
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0022.flac,108264,oh marilla what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0023.flac,88380,your hair must be cut off there is no other way you can't go out with it looking like that
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0024.flac,63762,with a dismal sigh she went for the scissors
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0025.flac,110383,but there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you've dyed it a dreadful color is there
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0026.flac,81863,i'm going to weep all the time you're cutting it off if it won't interfere
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0027.flac,50680,it seems such a tragic thing
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0028.flac,120060,anne wept then but later on when she went upstairs and looked in the glass she was calm with despair
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0029.flac,42117,yes i will too
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0030.flac,172608,i never thought i was vain about my hair of all things but now i know i was in spite of its being red because it was so long and thick and curly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0031.flac,71010,i expect something will happen to my nose next
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0032.flac,250015,anne's clipped head made a sensation in school on the following monday but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it not even josie pye who however did not fail to inform anne that she looked like a perfect scarecrow
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0033.flac,122810,it's hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and i wanted to say something back but i didn't
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0034.flac,83902,it makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people doesn't it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0035.flac,128362,i mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and i shall never try to be beautiful again
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0036.flac,48770,of course it's better to be good
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0037.flac,136795,i do really want to be good marilla like you and missus allan and miss stacy and grow up to be a credit to you
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0038.flac,128914,diana says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0039.flac,73021,i will call it a snood that sounds so romantic
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0040.flac,38340,my head is better now
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/700-122867-0041.flac,51362,it was terrible bad this afternoon though
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0000.flac,84162,i have been told that mister van brandt is in prison for debt i said
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0001.flac,79789,and i saw for myself last night that he had left you helpless
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0002.flac,98281,he left me the little money he had with him when he was arrested she rejoined sadly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0003.flac,96102,his cruel creditors are more to blame than he is for the poverty that has fallen on us
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0004.flac,130329,even this negative defense of van brandt stung me to the quick i ought to have spoken more guardedly of him i said bitterly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0005.flac,148033,i ought to have remembered that a woman can forgive almost any wrong that a man can inflict on her when he is the man whom she loves
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0006.flac,72990,she put her hand on my mouth and stopped me before i could say any more
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0007.flac,63044,how can you speak so cruelly to me she asked
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0008.flac,132855,you know to my shame i confessed it to you the last time we met you know that my heart in secret is all yours
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0009.flac,40705,what wrong are you talking of
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0010.flac,109584,is it the wrong i suffered when van brandt married me with a wife living at the time and living still
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0011.flac,121885,do you think i can ever forget the great misfortune of my life the misfortune that has made me unworthy of you
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0012.flac,181555,it is no fault of mine god knows but it is not the less true that i am not married and that the little darling who is playing out there with her doll is my child
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0013.flac,118582,and you talk of my being your wife knowing that the child accepts me as her second father i said
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0014.flac,125250,it would be better and happier for us both if you had as little pride as the child pride she repeated
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0015.flac,45255,in such a position as mine
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0016.flac,67921,a helpless woman with a mock husband in prison for debt
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0017.flac,59437,am i to marry you for my food and shelter
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0018.flac,97115,am i to marry you because there is no lawful tie that binds me to the father of my child
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0019.flac,86194,bad as he is he has not forsaken me he has been forced away
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0020.flac,102480,my only friend is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0021.flac,148661,the woman in my situation must be heartless indeed who could destroy your place in the estimation of the world and the regard of your friends
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0022.flac,95397,the wretchedest creature that walks the streets would shrink from treating you in that way
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0023.flac,40373,oh what are men made of
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0024.flac,59009,how can you how can you speak of it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0025.flac,48633,i yielded and spoke of it no more
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0026.flac,113874,every word she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom i had loved and lost
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0027.flac,177171,bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us i loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake hopeless infatuation
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0028.flac,117337,i don't deny it i don't excuse it hopeless infatuation you have forgiven me i said
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0029.flac,46300,let me deserve to be forgiven
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0030.flac,49635,it is something to be your only friend
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0031.flac,93175,you must have plans for the future tell me unreservedly how i can help you
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0032.flac,99437,complete the good work that you have begun she answered gratefully help me back to health
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0033.flac,120701,make me strong enough to submit to a doctor's estimate of my chances of living for some years yet
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0034.flac,88126,a doctor's estimate of your chances of living i repeated what do you mean
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0035.flac,94052,i hardly know how to tell you she said without speaking again of mister van brandt
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0036.flac,76623,does speaking of him again mean speaking of his debts i asked
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0037.flac,37672,why need you hesitate
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0038.flac,74599,you know that there is nothing i will not do to relieve your anxieties
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0039.flac,53779,never let me tell you the plain truth
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0040.flac,73729,there is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0041.flac,223801,yes this is his position in two words a little while since he obtained an excellent offer of employment abroad from a rich relative of his and he had made all his arrangements to accept it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0042.flac,127932,unhappily he returned to tell me of his good fortune and the same day he was arrested for debt
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0043.flac,87770,the snare that had been set for her was plainly revealed in those four words
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0044.flac,158513,in the eye of the law she was of course a single woman she was of age she was to all intents and purposes her own mistress
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0045.flac,176504,what was there to prevent her from insuring her life if she pleased and from so disposing of the insurance as to give van brandt a direct interest in her death
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0046.flac,126091,thanks to the happy accident of my position the one certain way of protecting her lay easily within my reach
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0047.flac,161764,i could offer to lend the scoundrel the money that he wanted at an hour's notice and he was the man to accept my proposal quite as easily as i could make it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0048.flac,48141,you are quite mistaken i replied
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0049.flac,128869,i am only doubting whether your plan for relieving mister van brandt of his embarrassments is quite so simple as you suppose
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0050.flac,136745,are you aware of the delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to borrow money on your policy of insurance
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0051.flac,58933,i know nothing about it she said sadly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0052.flac,58870,will you let me ask the advice of my lawyers
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0053.flac,100261,they are trustworthy and experienced men and i am sure they can be of use to you
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0054.flac,99109,cautiously as i had expressed myself her delicacy took the alarm
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0055.flac,146226,promise that you won't ask me to borrow money of you for mister van brandt she rejoined and i will accept your help gratefully
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0056.flac,43563,i could honestly promise that
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0057.flac,114745,my one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge the course that i had now determined to pursue
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0058.flac,75439,i rose to go while my resolution still sustained me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0059.flac,52399,kiss me she whispered before you go
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8173-294714-0060.flac,53934,it is only your goodness that overpowers me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0000.flac,275854,what is necessary to the completeness of the story at this stage is not to recapitulate but to take up some of the loose ends of threads woven in and follow them through until the clear and comprehensive picture of events can be seen

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0002.flac,174352,he can sometimes raise capital to help him in working out his crude conceptions but even then it is frequently done at a distressful cost of personal surrender
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0003.flac,259265,when the result is achieved the invention makes its appeal on the score of economy of material or of effort and then labor often awaits with crushing and tyrannical spirit to smash the apparatus or forbid its very use
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0004.flac,127721,possibly our national optimism as revealed in invention the seeking a higher good needs some check
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0005.flac,233760,possibly the leaders would travel too fast and too far on the road to perfection if conservatism did not also play its salutary part in insisting that the procession move forward as a whole
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0006.flac,109987,on the contrary the conditions for its acceptance had been ripening fast
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0007.flac,108471,yet the very vogue of the electric arc light made harder the arrival of the incandescent
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0008.flac,274529,a number of parent arc lighting companies were in existence and a great many local companies had been called into being under franchises for commercial business and to execute regular city contracts for street lighting
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0009.flac,313335,thus in a curious manner the modern art of electric lighting was in a very true sense divided against itself with intense rivalries and jealousies which were none the less real because they were but temporary and occurred in a field where ultimate union of forces was inevitable
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0010.flac,206217,hence twenty years after the first edison stations were established the methods they involved could be fairly credited with no less than sixty seven per cent
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0011.flac,365973,it will be readily understood that under these conditions the modern lighting company supplies to its customers both incandescent and arc lighting frequently from the same dynamo electric machinery as a source of current and that the old feud as between the rival systems has died out
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0012.flac,259491,in fact for some years past the presidents of the national electric light association have been chosen almost exclusively from among the managers of the great edison lighting companies in the leading cities
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0013.flac,108160,the other strong opposition to the incandescent light came from the gas industry
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0014.flac,63418,there also the most bitter feeling was shown
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0015.flac,182410,the gas manager did not like the arc light but it interfered only with his street service which was not his largest source of income by any means
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0016.flac,250205,here again was given a most convincing demonstration of the truth that such an addition to the resources of mankind always carries with it unsuspected benefits even for its enemies
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0017.flac,341296,this was not long nor universally the spirit shown and to day in hundreds of cities the electric and gas properties are united under the one management which does not find it impossible to push in a friendly and progressive way the use of both illuminants
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1585-131718-0018.flac,114593,the most conspicuous example of this identity of interest is given in new york itself

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0010.flac,63000,so guenever went to the gate to meet him and he entered
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0011.flac,175676,and geraint greets thee well and in greeting thee he compelled me to come hither to do thy pleasure for the insult which thy maiden received from the dwarf now where did he overtake thee

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0020.flac,203741,and being young he changed himself and grew to hate the sin that seem'd so like his own of modred arthur's nephew and fell at last in the great battle fighting for the king
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0021.flac,74207,and when geraint came to the place where guenever was he saluted her
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0022.flac,42221,then they went in and dismounted
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0023.flac,80311,heaven protect thee said arthur and the welcome of heaven be unto thee
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0024.flac,130731,and inasmuch as thou hast vanquished edeyrn the son of nudd thou hast had a prosperous career
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0025.flac,49097,and from that time she became his wife
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0026.flac,172442,and the maiden took up her abode in the palace and she had many companions both men and women and there was no maiden more esteemed than she in the island of britain
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0027.flac,128172,and a year and a second and a third he proceeded thus until his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0028.flac,118484,and he greets thee well as an uncle should greet his nephew and as a vassal should greet his lord
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0029.flac,115893,and the neighboring chiefs knowing this grow insolent towards him and covet his land and possessions
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0030.flac,237031,and arthur told geraint the cause of the mission and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of cornwall truly said geraint be it to my advantage or disadvantage lord i will do according to thy will concerning this embassy

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0035.flac,44374,and every one asked that which he desired
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0036.flac,152441,and they were not long in giving so eager was every one to bestow gifts and of those who came to ask gifts none departed unsatisfied
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0037.flac,74375,then geraint sent ambassadors to the men of cornwall to ask them this
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0038.flac,106106,and they all said that it would be the fulness of joy and honor to them for geraint to come and receive their homage
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172182-0039.flac,56883,so he received the homage of such as were there

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172183-0005.flac,167690,and evil betide me said he if thou returnest here until thou knowest whether i have lost my strength so completely as thou didst say
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3660-172183-0006.flac,44800,then geraint went to see erbin

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0011.flac,115934,the house owner then decides whether the day set by the builder is a lucky one for himself and his family
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0012.flac,374780,a present of money to each workman is also in order and will conduce to the rapid and faithful execution of the job in hand when at last the house is finished and carpenters and plasterers are ready to leave it the local firemen who have assisted all along in the building as unskilled laborers often ascend to the roof and from the ridge pole cast down cakes for which the children of the neighborhood scramble joyfully
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0013.flac,75135,all come who can and those who cannot come send servants or provisions
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0014.flac,170677,on the day after the death often in the evening the body must be placed in the cask shaped coffin that until recently was the style commonly in use in japan
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0015.flac,249200,now among the wealthier classes the long coffin has superseded the small square or round one but the smaller expense connected with burial in the old way makes the survival of the old type a necessity for the majority of japanese
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0016.flac,120254,at an appointed time all the relatives assemble in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0017.flac,150376,there is no official ceremonial mourning of parents for their children nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rites or attend the funeral
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0018.flac,114091,upon the younger brothers and sisters falls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0019.flac,101181,when the body has been washed it is dressed in white in silk habutai whenever the family can afford it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0020.flac,196326,the body to be placed in the coffin must be folded into a sitting posture the chin resting upon the knees the position of the mummies found in many aboriginal american tombs
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0021.flac,185977,this difficult to us apparently impossible feat safely accomplished there are placed in the coffin a number of small things that the dead takes with him to the next world
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0022.flac,158972,the single exception to this rule about metal is that small copper coins may be put in to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0024.flac,85062,so long as the coffin is in the house it must be watched over continually
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0025.flac,171961,it is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffin is never allowed to go out while the food for the dead is renewed at regular intervals by the mourners themselves
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0026.flac,311518,there are few enlightened japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted or who do not long for some change but so great is the force of conservatism in this regard so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respect for the dead that reform advances slowly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0027.flac,106618,individual instances occur in which some of the worst features of these customs are modified
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0028.flac,185842,a case in point is that of the late mister fukuzawa a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countrymen in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0029.flac,111235,in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0030.flac,140523,through this growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0031.flac,188069,just before the procession starts a religious ceremony is held at the house which is attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0032.flac,161696,on the day of the burial great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead each bunch so large as to require the services of one man to carry it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0033.flac,314155,sometimes with the gift a man is sent to take part in the procession but if the giver feels too poor to hire a man this burden too falls upon the bereaved household for etiquette requires that all flowers sent be borne to the grave by uniformed coolies who march in the funeral train
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0034.flac,146541,another favorite present at this time among buddhists is a cage of living birds to be borne to the grave and released thereon
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0035.flac,57395,it seems more like a bridal than a burial
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3915-98647-0036.flac,203353,during this period the spirit of the deceased is supposed to be still inhabiting the house and a tablet or shrine is set up in the death chamber before which food and flowers are renewed daily

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-66379-0015.flac,125432,the captain here told thompson to take six cords which would last till daylight and again turned his attention to the game

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-67804-0011.flac,48949,and turning about she walked out of the room
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-67804-0012.flac,50856,and nothing more had been said on the subject since

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-67804-0019.flac,48326,perhaps we owe this to lord lansdowne

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-67804-0021.flac,97959,she was enjoying herself mister francis barold observed it rather gloomily as he stood apart
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-67804-0022.flac,250107,and then had come lord lansdowne who in crossing the lawn to shake hands with his host had been observed to keep his eye fixed upon one particular point burmistone he said after having spoken his first words who is that tall girl in white
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-67804-0023.flac,192083,and in ten minutes lady theobald missus burnham mister barold and divers others too numerous to mention saw him standing at octavia's side evidently with no intention of leaving it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-67804-0024.flac,154338,not long after this francis barold found his way to miss belinda who was very busy and rather nervous your niece is evidently enjoying herself he remarked

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-67804-0029.flac,122239,he felt himself ill used by fate and rather wished he had returned to london from broadoaks instead of loitering in slowbridge

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-67803-0013.flac,71617,that is one of the reasons why she loathes me so she added
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-67803-0014.flac,116870,lucia thought deeply for a moment she recognized all at once several things she had been mystified by before

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-67803-0021.flac,79234,but it was not against him that lucia's indignation was aroused
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-67803-0022.flac,70584,she wondered if he had heard her last words she fancied he had

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6455-67803-0030.flac,142353,and then almost before she knew what she was doing she was pouring forth the whole of her story even more of it than she had told octavia

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6267-53049-0019.flac,439858,penelope was surprised as much as the tender sisterly heart could wish when doris flashed out upon her triumphantly on the evening of the party with the black skirt nicely pressed and re hung and the prettiest waist imaginable a waist that was a positive creation of dainty rose besprinkled silk with a girdle and knots of black velvet
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6267-53049-0020.flac,128310,so penelope went to blanche's party and her dress was the admiration of every girl there

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0002.flac,107948,captain wadsworth became a little uneasy though he was still inclined to treat the matter lightly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0003.flac,124057,we have stubbornly refused to yield our charter voluntarily for it is the guardian of our political rights
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0004.flac,206139,that is true captain wadsworth continued mister prince and to subdue our stubbornness this viceroy has come to hartford with sixty armed men to demand the surrender of the charter in person
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0005.flac,146159,captain wadsworth bounded to his feet in a rage and placing his hand on the hilt of his sword declared he shall not have it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0006.flac,142072,the day was well nigh spent when he arrived and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subject of the utmost importance
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0007.flac,122701,he consented however to await the discussion but as soon as it was ended he declared that he would have the charter
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0008.flac,108795,after the captain had taken two or three turns across the room he paused and asked
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0009.flac,61333,what is the assembly doing engaged in a debate
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0010.flac,77477,and will he wait until it has ended he has promised to do so

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0017.flac,85119,remember the work must be done right at the time not too soon nor too late
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0018.flac,52850,the sun was setting and the captain said
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0019.flac,63257,come charles let us hasten to the assembly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0020.flac,92545,by no means but i want you to be fully impressed with the seriousness of your mission
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0021.flac,78533,take your place charles and be prepared to do your part whispered captain wadsworth
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0022.flac,133188,charles got as close to the long table used by the secretaries as possible without attracting special attention
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0023.flac,137693,the discussion went on darkness came and four lighted candles were placed on the table and two set on a shelf on the wall
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0024.flac,106742,those two candles on the wall were a great annoyance to charles until he saw a man stationed near them
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0025.flac,115012,though the lights were extinguished through the windows the faint starlight dimly illuminated the scene
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0026.flac,45638,he followed him as rapidly as he could
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0027.flac,80573,the youth was close behind him and when they were outside seized his arm
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0028.flac,45030,boy have a care how you approach me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0029.flac,168468,the soldiers began to crowd about the house when at a signal from captain wadsworth the train bands came on the scene and prepared to grapple with the soldiers
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0030.flac,33860,where is the charter
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0031.flac,120397,you have your soldiers at the door and we have the train bands of connecticut ready to defend us against violence
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0032.flac,40768,who of you has the charter
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0033.flac,50389,it was the boy cried the enraged governor
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0034.flac,52302,every member of the assembly shook their heads
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0035.flac,79847,we do not know him he does not live in connecticut where does he live
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0036.flac,116488,little did the captain or his youthful assistant dream that their simple act would make the old tree historic
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0037.flac,99079,the tree in which the document was hidden was ever afterward known as the charter oak
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0038.flac,170437,it remained vigorous bearing fruit every year until a little after midnight august eighteen fifty six when it was prostrated by a heavy storm of wind
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0039.flac,161450,when the order for the seizure of the charters was first made known the assembly of rhode island sent a most loyal address to the king saying
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0040.flac,287346,he formally dissolved the assembly broke the seal of the colony which bore the figure of an anchor and the word hope admitted five of the inhabitants into his legislative council and assumed the functions of governor but he did not take away the parchment on which the charter was written
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0041.flac,325345,from that time until the enforced union of the colonies for mutual defence at the breaking out of the french and indian war the inhabitants of rhode island bore their share in the defensive efforts especially when the hostile savages hung along the frontiers of new york like an ill omened cloud
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50873-0042.flac,167455,the history of that commonwealth is identified with that of all new england from the beginning of king william's war soon after to the expulsion of andros

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50964-0013.flac,64755,and so our little friends had spent all their vacation
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0000.flac,60192,a beautiful day had grown out of the dreadful storm
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0001.flac,43519,and everybody was so happy
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0002.flac,198033,the neptune the vessel that had struck on the sand bar was now safely anchored near shore and the sailors came in and out in row boats back and forth to land just as they wished
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0003.flac,98679,then we had to go back to work at the logs went on the captain and then one of our crew took a fever
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0004.flac,38916,that was what delayed us so
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0005.flac,76443,finally we had every log loaded on the schooner and we started off
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0006.flac,103743,we counted on getting home last week when this last storm struck us and drove us out of our course
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0007.flac,72400,about the value asked mister bobbsey who was down from the city
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0008.flac,80329,the value repeated the captain aside so that the strangers might not hear
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0009.flac,200210,well i'm a rich man now and so is my mate mc laughlin for that wood was contracted for by the largest and richest piano firm in this country and now it is all but delivered to them and the money in our hands
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0010.flac,98642,yes indeed it would have taken us a lifetime to accumulate as much money as we have earned in this year
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0011.flac,81100,maybe aunt emily will take you down to the city on her shopping tour suggested nan
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0012.flac,95500,he made the clerks remove all the truck from the aisles and i guess everybody was glad the army fell down
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50963-0013.flac,209434,the wonderful fresh air that these men lived in night and day had brightened their eyes too so that even the plainest face and the most awkward man among them was as nimble as an athlete from his perfect exercise
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0000.flac,77024,called bert who had heard his uncle getting ready to run down to the water's edge
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0001.flac,89126,it's a schooner said mister bingham to mister minturn and she has a very heavy cargo
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0002.flac,54148,to this cord was fastened a heavy rope or cable
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0003.flac,74018,what's that board for asked bert as he saw a board following the cable
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0004.flac,40256,that's the directions said hal
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0005.flac,125857,they are printed in a number of languages and they tell the crew to carry the end of the cable high up the mast and fasten it strongly there
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0006.flac,100226,oh i see said bert the line will stretch then and the breeches buoy will go out on a pulley
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0007.flac,68083,it was clear day now and much of the wicked storm had passed
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0008.flac,54293,with the daylight came girls and women to the beach
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0009.flac,173565,missus bobbsey missus minturn nellie and her mother besides dorothy and nan were all there flossie and freddie being obliged to stay home with dinah and susan
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0010.flac,99046,of course the girls asked all sorts of questions and bert and hal tried to answer them as best they could
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0011.flac,85193,it seemed a long time before any movement of the cable showed that the buoy was returning
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0012.flac,64851,nearer and nearer it came until now a man's head could be seen
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0013.flac,80726,the girls and women were too frightened to talk and nellie clung close to her mother
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0014.flac,113075,a big roller dashing in finished the work for the life guards and a man in the cork belt bounded upon shore
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5849-50962-0015.flac,128123,everybody gathered around and nellie with a strange face and a stranger hope broke through the crowd to see the rescued man

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-157641-0012.flac,46488,psha look at his progress
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-157641-0013.flac,67415,thus the odour of tobacco was not brought into the drawing room
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-157641-0014.flac,159002,the journalists and bohemians who met at the cogers were above or below the dictates of fashion and smoking was always a feature of their gatherings
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-157641-0015.flac,105896,both queen victoria and the prince consort detested it so tobacco was taboo wherever the court was
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0000.flac,131330,the officers were about to take leave but prince andrew apparently reluctant to be left alone with his friend asked them to stay and have tea
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0001.flac,40532,seats were brought in and so was the tea
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0002.flac,139182,the officers gazed with surprise at pierre's huge stout figure and listened to his talk of moscow and the position of our army round which he had ridden
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0003.flac,59406,so you understand the whole position of our troops
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0004.flac,109802,not being a military man i can't say i have understood it fully but i understand the general position
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0005.flac,93646,well then you know more than anyone else be it who it may said prince andrew
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0006.flac,53027,and tell me your opinion of barclay de tolly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0007.flac,129506,pierre looked at timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0008.flac,159993,we see light again since his serenity has been appointed your excellency said timokhin timidly and continually turning to glance at his colonel
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0009.flac,41540,why so asked pierre
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0010.flac,35063,then why was it forbidden
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0011.flac,119626,at smolensk too he judged correctly that the french might outflank us as they had larger forces
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0012.flac,92129,he ordered us to retreat and all our efforts and losses went for nothing
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0013.flac,40319,so it has been with barclay
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0014.flac,154293,while russia was well a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0015.flac,69489,and they say he's a skillful commander rejoined pierre
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0016.flac,104951,i don't understand what is meant by a skillful commander replied prince andrew ironically
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0017.flac,50077,a skillful commander replied pierre
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0018.flac,43552,pierre looked at him in surprise
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0019.flac,74045,and yet they say that war is like a game of chess he remarked
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0020.flac,80628,the relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0021.flac,166525,success never depends and never will depend on position or equipment or even on numbers and least of all on position but on what then
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0022.flac,98000,on the feeling that is in me and in him he pointed to timokhin and in each soldier
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0023.flac,67150,a battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0024.flac,51784,why did we lose the battle at austerlitz
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0025.flac,60353,we've lost so let us run and we ran
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0026.flac,40480,but tomorrow we shan't say it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0027.flac,40920,but what awaits us tomorrow
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0028.flac,127477,the fact is that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only do not help matters but hinder
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0029.flac,61038,that's the truth the real truth said timokhin
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0030.flac,43827,it's not the day for that they say
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0031.flac,57265,all were silent the officers rose
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0032.flac,60009,yes yes answered prince andrew absently
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0033.flac,166094,the french have destroyed my home and are on their way to destroy moscow they have outraged and are outraging me every moment they are my enemies
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0034.flac,49529,in my opinion they are all criminals
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0035.flac,51986,and so thinks timokhin and the whole army
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0036.flac,96296,since they are my foes they cannot be my friends whatever may have been said at tilsit
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0037.flac,78882,yes yes muttered pierre looking with shining eyes at prince andrew
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0038.flac,145976,they talk to us of the rules of war of chivalry of flags of truce of mercy to the unfortunate and so on it's all rubbish
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0039.flac,191726,they plunder other people's houses issue false paper money and worst of all they kill my children and my father and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0040.flac,59984,take no prisoners but kill and be killed
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0041.flac,206923,prince andrew who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not moscow was taken as smolensk had been was suddenly checked in his speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0042.flac,142826,he paced up and down a few times in silence but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0043.flac,62380,and when there was a war like this one it would be war
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0044.flac,52594,what is needed for success in warfare
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0045.flac,96997,and in spite of all this it is the highest class respected by everyone
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0046.flac,51803,how does god above look at them and hear them
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0047.flac,63099,i see that i have begun to understand too much
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0048.flac,137257,and it doesn't do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil ah well it's not for long he added
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0049.flac,66513,however you're sleepy and it's time for me to sleep
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0050.flac,57556,go back to gorki said prince andrew suddenly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0051.flac,85540,go go before a battle one must have one's sleep out repeated prince andrew
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0052.flac,50635,no he does not want it pierre concluded
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0053.flac,53907,and i know that this is our last meeting
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0054.flac,60602,one picture succeeded another in his imagination
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1650-167613-0055.flac,52672,on one of them he dwelt long and joyfully
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0000.flac,178668,at this moment the heavy beat of the storm on the roof ceased with miraculous suddenness leaving the outside world empty of sound save for the drip drip drip of eaves
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0001.flac,120735,we had every sort of people with us off and on and as i was lookout at a popular game i saw them all
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0002.flac,107070,at the same instant i heard the rip of steel through cloth and felt a sharp stab in my left leg
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0003.flac,82637,then i scouted to see what had cut me and found that the fellow had lost a hand
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0004.flac,56979,in place of it he wore a sharp steel hook
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0005.flac,125458,there was no doubt of his being alive for he was breathing hard like a man does when he gets hit over the head it didn't sound good
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0006.flac,55591,when a man breathes that way he's mostly all gone
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0007.flac,58789,men got batted over the head often enough in those days
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0008.flac,88710,sour wine is fine to put a wound in shape to heal but it's no soothing syrup
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0009.flac,209469,their coffin was their ship and their grave it was the sea blow high blow low what care we and the quarter that we gave them was to sink them in the sea down on the coast of the high barbaree
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0010.flac,274818,it fair made my hair rise to hear him with the big still solemn desert outside and the quiet moonlight and the shadows and him sitting up straight and gaunt his eyes blazing each side his big eagle nose and his snaky hair hanging over the raw cut across his head
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0011.flac,101499,however i made out to get him bandaged up and in shape and pretty soon he sort of went to sleep
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0012.flac,160706,then again he'd sing that barbaree song until i'd go out and look at the old colorado flowing by just to be sure i hadn't died and gone below or else he'd just talk
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0013.flac,97708,he began when he was a kid and he gave his side of conversations pausing for replies
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0014.flac,134898,i used to listen by the hour but i never made out anything really important as to who the man was or where he'd come from or what he'd done
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0015.flac,52624,i didn't pay any attention to him for he was quiet
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0016.flac,100418,usually i didn't bother with his talk for it didn't mean anything but something in his voice made me turn
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0017.flac,117636,he was lying on his side those black eyes of his blazing at me but now both of them saw the same distance
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0018.flac,51931,where are my clothes he asked very intense
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0019.flac,68939,one little squeeze talk about your deadly weapons
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0020.flac,55135,but he'd been too sick and too long abed
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0021.flac,41194,in a minute or so he came to
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0022.flac,102068,now you're a nice sweet proposition said i as soon as i was sure he could understand me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0023.flac,50731,they're safe enough let me have them he begged
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0024.flac,73420,now look here said i you can't get up to day you ain't fit
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0025.flac,52225,i know he pleaded but let me see them
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0026.flac,62390,just to satisfy him i passed over his old duds
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0027.flac,40361,i've been robbed he cried
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0028.flac,35723,where's my coat he asked
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0029.flac,50535,you had no coat when i picked you up i replied
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0030.flac,103645,he looked at me mighty suspicious but didn't say anything more he wouldn't even answer when i spoke to him
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0031.flac,52504,after he'd eaten a fair meal he fell asleep
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0032.flac,61179,when i came back that evening the bunk was empty and he was gone
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0033.flac,45189,i didn't see him again for two days
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0034.flac,44554,then i caught sight of him quite a ways off
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0035.flac,129817,guess he suspicions i stole that old coat of his thinks i and afterwards i found that my surmise had been correct
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0036.flac,55237,however he didn't stay long in that frame of mind
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0037.flac,37658,i ran up pulling my gun
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0038.flac,64657,the mex was flat on his face his arms stretched out
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0039.flac,48960,on the middle of his back knelt my one armed friend
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0040.flac,102445,anyway i thrust the muzzle of my colt's into the sailor's face what's this i asked
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0041.flac,77003,i ween heem at monte off antonio curvez said he
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0042.flac,65773,the gleam died from his eye the snarl left his lips
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0043.flac,78951,in any case he flew poco pronto leaving me and my friend together
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0044.flac,113006,during the next two months he was a good deal about town mostly doing odd jobs i saw him off and on
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0045.flac,109729,however i didn't pay much attention to that being at the time almighty busy holding down my card games
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0046.flac,60149,that's all right said i but you better stay right there
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0047.flac,52820,i want to make up to you for your trouble said he
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0048.flac,59710,what kind of a good thing i asked treasure said he
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0049.flac,53137,he looked all right enough neither drunk nor loco
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0050.flac,65106,sit down said i over there the other side the table
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0051.flac,50058,he did so now fire away said i
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0052.flac,112969,and it's a big thing said handy solomon to me for they's not only gold but altar jewels and diamonds
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0053.flac,82953,it will make us rich and a dozen like us and you can kiss the book on that
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0054.flac,61698,that may all be true said i but why do you tell me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0055.flac,61813,why don't you get your treasure without the need of dividing it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0056.flac,59335,why mate he answered it's just plain gratitude
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0057.flac,77426,didn't you save my life and nuss me and take care of me when i was nigh killed
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0058.flac,229901,look here anderson or handy solomon or whatever you please to call yourself i rejoined to this if you're going to do business with me and i do not understand yet just what it is you want of me you'll have to talk straight
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0059.flac,69694,it's all very well to say gratitude but that don't go with me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0060.flac,70184,the devil's a preacher if you ain't lost your pinfeathers said he
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0061.flac,89957,well it's this then i got to have a boat to get there and she must be stocked
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0062.flac,83601,and i got to have help with the treasure if it's like this fellow said it was
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0063.flac,119242,it's money i got to have and it's money i haven't got and can't get unless i let somebody in as pardner
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0064.flac,52551,why me i asked why not he retorted
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0065.flac,37221,we talked the matter over at length
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0066.flac,41448,i stood out for a larger party
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0067.flac,175005,he strongly opposed this as depreciating the shares but i had no intention of going alone into what was then considered a wild and dangerous country finally we compromised
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88294-0068.flac,146466,a third of the treasure was to go to him a third to me and the rest was to be divided among the men whom i should select this scheme did not appeal to him
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88291-0000.flac,156221,but since there existed for us no responsibility we each reported dutifully at the roll call of habit and dropped back into our blankets with a grateful sigh
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88291-0001.flac,293567,i remember the moon sailing a good gait among apparently stationary cloudlets i recall a deep black shadow lying before distant silvery mountains i glanced over the stark motionless canvases each of which concealed a man the air trembled with the bellowing of cattle in the corrals
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88291-0002.flac,80203,seemingly but a moment later the cook's howl brought me to consciousness again
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88291-0003.flac,208824,three were to care for the remuda five were to move the stray herd from the corrals to good feed three branding crews were told to brand the calves we had collected in the cut of the afternoon before that took up about half the men
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88291-0004.flac,59194,the rest were to make a short drive in the salt grass
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6841-88291-0005.flac,109460,we were the only ones who did go afoot however although the corrals were not more than two hundred yards distant

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4323-13259-0001.flac,174883,and all through his impassioned appeal this morning there was a note of sadness and rebuke and stern condemnation that made many of the members pale with self accusation or with inward anger

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4323-13259-0010.flac,153637,the meeting was tender it glowed with the spirit's presence it was alive with strong and lasting resolve to begin a war on the whiskey power in raymond that would break its reign forever
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4323-13259-0011.flac,159166,since the first sunday when the first company of volunteers had pledged themselves to do as jesus would do the different meetings had been characterized by distinct impulses or impressions
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4323-13259-0012.flac,90247,and all through it ran one general cry for deliverance from the saloon and its awful curse
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4323-13259-0013.flac,135878,gray and his wife were besieged by inquirers who wanted to know what loreen's friends and acquaintances were expected to do in paying their last respects to her

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4323-13259-0016.flac,42715,i will be guided by your judgment in the matter

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4323-13259-0019.flac,133611,it happened that that afternoon a somewhat noted newspaper correspondent was passing through raymond on his way to an editorial convention in a neighboring city
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4323-13259-0020.flac,152356,she was a common street drunkard and yet the services at the tent were as impressive as any i ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4323-13259-0021.flac,184982,it struck me of course being a stranger in the place with considerable astonishment to hear voices like those one naturally expects to hear only in great churches or concerts at such a meeting as this
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4323-13259-0022.flac,175806,mister maxwell spoke of the fact that the dead woman had been fully prepared to go but he spoke in a peculiarly sensitive manner of the effect of the liquor business on the lives of men and women like this one
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4323-13259-0023.flac,107103,raymond of course being a railroad town and the centre of the great packing interests for this region is full of saloons
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4323-13259-0024.flac,66745,then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/4323-13259-0025.flac,89901,it was one of the simplest and at the same time one of the most impressive sights i ever witnessed

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5543-27761-0058.flac,172453,she saw clearly that there could be no possible connexion between a child's quite ordinary diversion and the continuation of the child's life
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5543-27761-0059.flac,191072,she made a special effort that evening to occupy her mind with other matters but her thoughts returned involuntarily to the fact that lelechka loved to hide herself

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5543-27761-0061.flac,55573,then she would look out with a sly glance
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5543-27761-0062.flac,262914,though she reproached herself at once for this unfounded superstitious dread nevertheless she could not enter wholeheartedly into the spirit of lelechka's favourite game and she tried to divert lelechka's attention to something else

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/5543-27761-0065.flac,168963,perhaps thought serafima aleksandrovna she is not as strongly drawn to the world as other children who are attracted by many things

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0038.flac,141532,yes that's right if it can be done but it would go hard with us all if the indians gave up the bait of the trap and turned upon those who set it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0039.flac,56599,well you must talk it over with father said chris

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0044.flac,80250,not quite my lads don't you see that we're playing a very ticklish game
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0045.flac,223503,just then the doctor came into the shelter where the boys had been talking bringing with him wilton who had been shooting or rather trying to shoot for he had had no success and they too were talking earnestly about ways and means
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0046.flac,49319,oh here you are griggs cried the doctor

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0048.flac,117713,the indians have shifted their quarters and they're in about as awkward a position as they could contrive for our purpose
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0049.flac,56058,we must get away from here to some good hunting ground
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0050.flac,58931,do the indians seem to be camping or only on the move
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0051.flac,70327,they seem to me to be hatching up some dodge or another replied griggs
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0052.flac,78109,then he began to walk up and down slowly evidently deep in thought
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0053.flac,54972,there he said i've made up my mind
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0054.flac,128323,it is very evident that we may wait here till our stores are exhausted and be as far off the opportunity we seek as ever
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0055.flac,75230,the indians can wait we cannot and they seem to know it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0056.flac,65570,going to give up young chris's plan said griggs slowly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0057.flac,86265,no i'm going to put it in force at once we start to night
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0058.flac,56928,but all the same we can be making our preparations
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0059.flac,59132,the barrels can be filled with water and every one's bottle
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0060.flac,89921,provisions can be packed in our wallets in fact everything held ready for a start
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0061.flac,80400,finally just at dusk the animals can be driven in for food and water and
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0062.flac,43323,exactly replied the doctor
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0063.flac,88273,but before any more is said griggs i want to offer you the opportunity to draw back
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0064.flac,47994,what for said griggs sharply
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0065.flac,68637,not a bit of it sir i'm going to take care they don't hit me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0066.flac,134836,i mean to do a bit to carry out young chris's plan and shut up the redskins for a week or two perhaps a month while we get right away
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0067.flac,49233,there is a horrible side to it griggs
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0068.flac,55680,would be if we let them get the better of us sir
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0069.flac,55710,you mean the shutting up the enemy here to starve
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0070.flac,94643,ejaculated griggs so sharply that the boys started serve em right if they did sir
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0071.flac,80930,what business have they to want our scalps but we shouldn't shut them up to starve
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/8254-84205-0072.flac,100965,they'd have weeks of work before they could get their horses out but without horses they'd be out in a week

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-11278-0016.flac,182575,and yet all these instances of fond and credulous snobbishness have occurred in the same week's paper with who knows how many score more
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-11278-0017.flac,86070,we are three sisters from seventeen to twenty two

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-11278-0021.flac,136415,we never write on perfumed paper in short i can't help thinking that if you knew us you would not think us snobs
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-11278-0022.flac,126287,i shall have a black crape round my white hat and my usual bamboo cane with the richly gilt knob

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-11278-0033.flac,112323,that very confidence savours of arrogance and to be arrogant is to be a snob
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-11278-0034.flac,128246,but are there no kindly natures no tender hearts no souls humble simple and truth loving
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-11278-0035.flac,61223,ponder well on this question sweet young ladies
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-169427-0000.flac,464035,interest however still runs on in both cases the periodical or accidental payments of it just serving to keep the memory of the affair alive till at length in some evil hour pop comes the creditor upon each and by demanding principal upon the spot together with full interest to the very day makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-169427-0001.flac,291651,as the reader for i hate your ifs has a thorough knowledge of human nature i need not say more to satisfy him that my hero could not go on at this rate without some slight experience of these incidental mementos
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-169427-0002.flac,503237,to speak the truth he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book debts of this stamp which notwithstanding eugenius's frequent advice he too much disregarded thinking that as not one of them was contracted thro any malignancy but on the contrary from an honesty of mind and a mere jocundity of humour they would all of them be cross'd out in course
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-169427-0003.flac,268617,eugenius would never admit this and would often tell him that one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with and he would often add in an accent of sorrowful apprehension to the uttermost mite
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-169427-0004.flac,84874,what inclined eugenius to the same opinion was as follows
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-169427-0005.flac,134977,yorick followed eugenius with his eyes to the door he then closed them and never opened them more
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/2506-169427-0006.flac,48513,alas poor yorick
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0000.flac,154851,i was tormented by thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctors orders
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0001.flac,144733,that old man ceased to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0002.flac,93506,felice had given them orders not to speak to me of this
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0003.flac,218510,this maid had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear of being detected she would have been very glad if i had died
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0004.flac,302602,accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full one i then covered myself and began to sweat and fell into a deep sleep
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0005.flac,142782,they say that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so grieved was he to hear this
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0006.flac,244397,afterwards he took an ugly stick and began to beat the serving girl with all his might shouting out ah traitress you have killed him for me then
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0007.flac,159247,she may indeed have saved my life so lend me a helping hand for i have sweated and be quick about it
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0008.flac,213986,felice recovered his spirits dried and made me comfortable and i being conscious of a great improvement in my state began to reckon on recovery
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0009.flac,185096,just then the other doctor bernardino put in his appearance who at the beginning of my illness had refused to bleed me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0010.flac,147697,maestro francesco that most able man exclaimed oh power of nature
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0011.flac,87816,she knows what she requires and the physicians know nothing
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0012.flac,183481,that simpleton maestro bernardino made answer saying if he had drunk another bottle he would have been cured upon the spot
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0013.flac,106639,afterwards he turned to me and asked if i could have drunk more water
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0014.flac,102857,i answered no because i had entirely quenched my thirst
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0015.flac,148070,in like manner she was asking for what she wanted when the poor young man begged you to bleed him
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0016.flac,157347,if you knew that his recovery depended upon his drinking two flasks of water why did you not say so before
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0017.flac,59789,you might then have boasted of his cure
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0018.flac,127648,at these words the wretched quack sulkily departed and never showed his face again
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0019.flac,165407,the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the cold
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0020.flac,198434,do not permit him any irregularities for though he has escaped this time another disorder now would be the death of him
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0021.flac,318358,then he turned to me and said my benvenuto be prudent commit no excesses and when you are quite recovered i beg you to make me a madonna with your own hand and i will always pay my devotions to it for your sake
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0022.flac,77876,so i made my mind up and prepared to travel
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0023.flac,176822,that day many friends came to see me among others pier landi who was the best and dearest friend i ever had
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0024.flac,150299,next day there came a certain niccolo da monte aguto who was also a very great friend of mine
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0025.flac,316161,i had harboured him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house upside down for the man was subject to a species of dry scab which he was always in the habit of scratching with his hands
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0026.flac,153003,meanwhile that able physician francesco da monte varchi attended to my cure with great skill
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0027.flac,95201,there they seated me to wait until the duke went by
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0028.flac,359278,many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprise that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shattered by illness they said that i ought to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0029.flac,249970,at these words maestro agostino the dukes tailor made his way through all those gentlemen and said if that is all you want to know you shall know it at this very moment
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0030.flac,283939,giorgio the painter whom i have mentioned happened just then to pass and maestro agostino exclaimed there is the man who accused you now you know yourself if it be true or not
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0031.flac,170784,as fiercely as i could not being able to leave my seat i asked giorgio if it was true that he had accused me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0032.flac,114735,he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sort
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0033.flac,94091,maestro agostino retorted you gallows bird
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0034.flac,75392,dont you know that i know it for most certain
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0035.flac,113009,giorgio made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0036.flac,193962,then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0037.flac,223061,the duke gazed at me and marvelled i was still alive afterwards he bade me take heed to be an honest man and regain my health
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0038.flac,559689,when i reached home niccolo da monte aguto came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards take french leave because my jeopardy came from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0039.flac,165664,i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had injured me and told him all the affair about the mint
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0040.flac,220863,he repeated get hence as quickly as you can and be of good courage for you will see your vengeance executed sooner than you expect
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0041.flac,284565,i the best attention to my health gave pietro pagolo advice about stamping the coins and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0042.flac,81323,you want them to immortalise that ferocious tyrant
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0043.flac,316758,you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you our inveterate foe and their devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mind to hang you without any fault of yours
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0044.flac,113554,it was firmly believed that duke alessandro was the son of pope clement
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0045.flac,215270,messer francesco used also to say and swear by all his saints that if he could he would have robbed me of the dies for that medal
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0046.flac,164720,i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0047.flac,143743,i now sent to florence to request lorenzino that he would send me the reverse of the medal
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0048.flac,375732,niccolo da monte aguto to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lorenzino for it he had replied that he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0049.flac,312967,nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better invent one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bring it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0050.flac,177275,i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate and pressed the work forward to my best ability
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0051.flac,177843,this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used often to laugh together about the great credit he had gained
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0052.flac,210311,i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling piece ready and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0053.flac,219421,i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to hit my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of loading
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172528-0054.flac,146827,i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we made haste for rome
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172005-0000.flac,106665,the fawn had taken his morning meal and now lay curled up on a bed of moss
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172005-0001.flac,81384,whenever the fawn caught up he was quite content to frisk about
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172005-0002.flac,65180,the danger was certain now it was near
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172005-0003.flac,88839,the hounds had struck her trail where she turned and the fawn was safe
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172005-0004.flac,95861,one was rowing the other had a gun in his hand what should she do
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172005-0005.flac,86972,her tired legs could not propel the tired body rapidly
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172005-0006.flac,48143,the doe saw the boat nearing her
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/3663-172005-0007.flac,137617,in a moment more the boat was on her and the man at the oars had leaned over and caught her
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0000.flac,55187,he is not by temperament a singer
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0001.flac,128668,his music is a still small voice unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and storm
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0002.flac,145354,truth to tell mister hardy is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0003.flac,92592,he does not express life easily in beautiful words or in images
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0004.flac,87679,thus he writes in i found her out there of one who
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0005.flac,120294,there could not be an uglier and more prosaic exaggeration than is contained in the image in the last line
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0006.flac,84262,and prose intrudes in the choice of words as well as in images
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0007.flac,107096,take for example the use of the word domiciled in the passage in the same poem about
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0008.flac,146502,when we as strangers sought their catering care veiled smiles bespoke their thought of what we were
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0009.flac,60354,catering care is an appalling phrase
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0010.flac,44664,is a line of good poetry
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0011.flac,393902,you did not come and marching time drew on and wore me numb yet less for loss of your dear presence there than that i thus found lacking in your make that high compassion which can overbear reluctance for pure loving kindness sake grieved i when as the hope hour stroked its sum you did not come
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0012.flac,260244,there are hints of the grand style of lyric poetry in these lines but phrases like in your make and as the hope hour stroked its sum are discords that bring it tumbling to the levels of victorian commonplace
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0013.flac,138923,he has a temperament sensitive beyond that of all but a few recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0014.flac,263923,one can remember poem after poem of his with a theme that might easily have served for mister hardy too late cristina the lost mistress the last ride together the statue and the bust to name a few
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0015.flac,78187,but what a sense of triumph there is in browning's tragedies
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0016.flac,71190,his world is a place of opulence not of poverty
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0017.flac,139085,to have loved even for an hour is with browning to live for ever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0018.flac,159780,to have loved for an hour is in mister hardy's imagination to have deepened the sadness even more than the beauty of one's memories
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0019.flac,158980,for then i undistrest by hearts grown cold to me could lonely wait my endless rest with equanimity
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0020.flac,191298,but time to make me grieve part steals lets part abide and shakes this fragile frame at eve with throbbings of noontide
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0021.flac,143578,and despair is by no means triumphant in what is perhaps the most attractive of all mister hardy's poems the oxen
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0022.flac,170472,we pictured the meek mild creatures where they dwelt in their strawy pen nor did it occur to one of us there to doubt they were kneeling then
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0023.flac,133503,the mood of faith however or rather of delight in the memory of faith is not mister hardy's prevailing mood
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0024.flac,124819,he can enter upon a war without ironical doubts as we see in the song men who march away
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0025.flac,73191,how long he cries in a poem written some years ago
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0026.flac,258757,when shall the saner softer polities whereof we dream have sway in each proud land and patriotism grown godlike scorn to stand bondslave to realms but circle earth and seas
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0027.flac,371679,but perhaps his characteristic attitude to war is to be found not in lines like these but in that melancholy poem the souls of the slain in which the souls of the dead soldiers return to their country and question a senior soul flame as to how their friends and relatives have kept their doughty deeds in remembrance
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0028.flac,97577,and general how hold out our sweethearts sworn loyal as doves
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0029.flac,78620,some fickle and fleet hearts have found them new loves
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0030.flac,96987,and our wives quoth another resignedly dwell they on our deeds
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0031.flac,104505,mister hardy has too bitter a sense of reality to believe much in the glory of war

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59186-0033.flac,165867,it may be thought on the other hand that mister hardy's poems about war are no more expressive of tragic futility than his poems about love

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0003.flac,173336,certainly the lust of cruelty the lust of destruction for destruction's sake is the most conspicuous of the deadly sins in dostoevsky's men and women

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0024.flac,77893,it is easy to see why dostoevsky has become a popular author
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0025.flac,100294,no melodramatist ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a horn of plenty
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0026.flac,67647,dostoevsky is always ready to show them all in at once
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0027.flac,488668,on two opposite pages of the idiot one finds the following characters brought in by name general epanchin prince s adelaida ivanovna lizaveta prokofyevna yevgeny pavlovitch radomsky princess byelokonsky aglaia prince myshkin kolya ivolgin ippolit varya ferdyshchenko nastasya filippovna nina alexandrovna ganya ptitsyn and general ivolgin
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0028.flac,121690,but the secret of dostoevsky's appeal is something more than the multitude and thrill of his incidents and characters
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0029.flac,80325,mister murry boldly faces the difficulty and attempts the definition
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0030.flac,183399,to him dostoevsky's work is the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life it is more than a record of struggle it is the struggle itself
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0031.flac,216163,and those voices take shape in certain unforgettable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly mean tavern set in surrounding darkness
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0032.flac,128255,ultimately they are the creations not of a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0033.flac,70356,because they are possessed they are no longer men and women
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0034.flac,47071,this is all in a measure true
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0035.flac,182126,to say this is not to deny the spiritual content of dostoevsky's work the anguish of the imprisoned soul as it battles with doubt and denial and despair
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0036.flac,133146,there is in dostoevsky a suggestion of caliban trying to discover some better god than setebos
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0037.flac,139624,the ultimate attitude of dostoevsky is as christian as the apostle peter's lord i believe help thou mine unbelief
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0038.flac,140014,and beyond the dark night of suffering and dissipating the night dostoevsky still sees the light of christian compassion
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0039.flac,82914,or even by the compassion of others like prince myshkin in the idiot
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0040.flac,88901,his work like his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0043.flac,226288,when he became excited on a certain point one could have sworn that one had seen him before seated on a bench in a police court awaiting trial or among vagabonds who passed their time begging before the prison doors
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0044.flac,136955,at all other times he carried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of old slavonic saints
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0045.flac,139463,that is the portrait of the man one sees behind dostoevsky's novels a portrait one might almost have inferred from the novels
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/6123-59150-0046.flac,65115,it is a figure that at once fascinates and repels

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/1701-141760-0047.flac,87267,but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy's fire

data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0004.flac,79589,thirdly this is proved from a property of man and of other animals
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0005.flac,100760,now whatever is participated is subject to what is essential and universal
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0006.flac,83828,therefore the subjection of other animals to man is proved to be natural
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0007.flac,219915,they would not however on this account have been excepted from the mastership of man as neither at present are they for that reason excepted from the mastership of god whose providence has ordained all this
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0008.flac,142225,this is signified by the fact that god led the animals to man that he might give them names expressive of their respective natures
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0009.flac,127454,so all animals would have obeyed man of their own accord as in the present state some domestic animals obey him
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0010.flac,144421,objection one it would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have had mastership over all other creatures
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0011.flac,85152,much less therefore would it have obeyed man in the state of innocence
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0012.flac,167204,therefore since it is by his reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems that in the state of innocence man had no dominion over plants
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0013.flac,84039,now in man reason has the position of a master and not of a subject
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0014.flac,346379,i answer that we must needs admit that in the primitive state there would have been some inequality at least as regards sex because generation depends upon diversity of sex and likewise as regards age for some would have been born of others nor would sexual union have been sterile
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0015.flac,60565,there might also have been bodily disparity
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0016.flac,117129,inequality might also arise on the part of nature as above described without any defect of nature
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0017.flac,114697,objection one it would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have been master over man
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0018.flac,84786,therefore in the state of innocence man would not have been subject to man
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0019.flac,205904,in another sense mastership is referred in a general sense to any kind of subject and in this sense even he who has the office of governing and directing free men can be called a master
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245712-0020.flac,113130,such a kind of mastership would have existed in the state of innocence between man and man for two reasons
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245715-0000.flac,88884,but in the state of innocence there would have been no weakness of old age
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245715-0001.flac,175291,on the contrary everything generated is first imperfect but in the state of innocence children would have been begotten by generation
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245715-0002.flac,104866,therefore from the first they would have been imperfect in bodily size and power
data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-other-new/7697-245715-0003.flac,218587,therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be born on the contrary nature's process in generation would have been in harmony with the manner in which it was established by god
